# Worldgen Flexiblifier

A tool for making various aspects of Minecraft worldgen more flexible. Meant to be used by mod authors or modpack/datapack
developers. Artifacts are available on [CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldgen-flexiblifier) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/worldgenflexiblifier), or on my maven: https://maven.lukebemish.dev/releases/dev/lukebemish/worldgenflexiblifier/

## Features

For more documentation on features, see the [wiki](https://github.com/lukebemishprojects/WorldgenFlexiblifier/wiki).

### [Dripstone Generation](https://github.com/lukebemishprojects/WorldgenFlexiblifier/wiki/Dripstone-Generation)

The vanilla dripstone feature types (`dripstone_cluster`, `large_dripstone`, and `pointed_dripstone`) can now be
configured to place blocks other than dripstone.

### [Ore Veins](https://github.com/lukebemishprojects/WorldgenFlexiblifier/wiki/Flexible-Ore-Veins)

A new feature type, `worldgenflexiblifier:ore_vein`, has been added, which re-implements the vanilla "large ore veins"
(which contain a filler stone and some ore blocks) so that custom veins can easily be added.
